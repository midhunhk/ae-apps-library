This Android library project contains some reusable code that can be used across projects. Depending on the features you use, make sure to declare the permissions in your manifest.xml file. Whenever I come across any piece of code that seems reusable, it will be moved to this library project.

## Library Name
The library name represents **Artistik Expressionz** since all my apps follow the package structure "com.ae.apps.[appname]". It is short and all my design works come under same name.

The library [codenames](https://github.com/midhunhk/lib-aeapps/wiki/Codenames) are based on fruits, mostly berries.
